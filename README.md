My work in own brand Career Leader is aligned to deepest purpose to put my efforts in great life's conditions creation for current & next generation.

I do it through my most loved niche - an IT. Where I came from the IT recruitment side (after some web development courses in early 2018). 

Sorry, coding is not for me :):) But working in this atmosphere - oh, Yes. It's totally mine.

Use my talents of information search, learning, structuring, listening, thinking out of the box & creative idea finding 

+ knowledge & exprerience in different business building parts.

How can support? What problems to solve?

Oh, I really am on leadership skill teaching through Career Mentoring.

Can support with knowledge & resources of Job searching & Requalification in smaller services of Career Consulting.

& currently learning Brand Strategy to put this in IT start-up building services - a new challenge for me :):)
So excited :):)
