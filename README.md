Sorry, coding is not for me :):) But working in this atmosphere - oh, Yes. It's totally mine.

Was in recruitment for 5 years helping Latvia & Baltics companies to find & attract IT specialists (middle, senior, team lead) - mostly in Developers, actually.

Were worked closely to companies CTO/team leads in larger ones, HR & CEO's.
